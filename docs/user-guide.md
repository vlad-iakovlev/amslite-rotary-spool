## 1. Glue Application for Printed Parts

When printing and assembling parts separately, some areas require glue to ensure a secure bond. Please refer to the [Glue Application Position Guide](./glue_application_positions.md) for detailed instructions and illustrations on where to apply the glue.

## 2. Grease Application Locations

Proper lubrication helps ensure smooth operation of the parts, reducing friction and wear. Please refer to the following sections to learn where to apply grease:

- Apply grease to the contact points between the core and the shaft to ensure smooth operation of the torsion spring.
- Apply a moderate amount of grease to the two washers where the shaft contacts the housing, reducing friction.

## 3. Using the Torsion Spring Jig

Creating torsion springs requires the use of a specialized jig tool. Here are the steps for using the torsion spring bending jig:

1. Print the appropriate torsion spring bending template according to the specifications of the torsion spring (left-hand or right-hand twist).
2. Prepare the torsion spring that needs to be bent.
3. Place the torsion spring into the designated slot on the jig.
4. Use appropriate tools to apply pressure and bend the torsion spring to the desired angle.

## 4. Rotary Spool Assembly

The assembly of the rotary spool includes the following steps:

1. Ensure that all parts are prepared and aligned according to the design drawings.
2. Assemble the core and claw seat in the correct order and orientation.
3. Install the torsion spring and ensure it is properly secured.
4. Attach the rotary spool to the desired position.
