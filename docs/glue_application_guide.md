# Glue Application Position Guide

When printing parts separately and assembling them, certain areas require glue application to ensure a strong bond. Below is a guide for glue application positions on different parts. Please apply glue to the areas marked in red in the images.

## 1. Claw Seat

- **Base and Clip Part:** Apply glue to the contact area between the base and the clip of the claw seat to ensure a strong bond between these two parts.

## 2. Green Core

- **Clip Part:** Apply glue to the clip part of the green core to ensure the clip is securely fixed.
- **Torsion Spring Center Fixing:** Apply glue to the contact area between the torsion spring center and the core to ensure a stable fix for the torsion spring.
- **Torsion Spring Short End Fixing:** Apply glue to the contact area between the short end of the torsion spring and the core to ensure the torsion spring is correctly fixed.

## 3. Yellow Core

- **Clip Part:** Apply glue to the clip part of the yellow core to ensure the clip is securely fixed.
- **Torsion Spring Center Fixing:** Apply glue to the contact area between the torsion spring center and the core to ensure a stable fix for the torsion spring.
- **Torsion Spring Short End Fixing:** Apply glue to the contact area between the short end of the torsion spring and the core to ensure the torsion spring is correctly fixed.

## 4. Shaft

- **Round Rod Part:** Apply glue to the contact area between the round rod of the shaft and other connecting parts.
- **Top Disc and Torsion Spring Long End Fixing:** Apply glue to the contact area between the top disc and the long end of the torsion spring to ensure the long end of the torsion spring is securely fixed.

## Assembly Steps

1. **Select Glue:** Use a strong adhesive suitable for plastic or 3D printed parts.
2. **Apply Glue:** Apply glue evenly to the contact areas marked in red in the images above.
3. **Assemble Parts:** Quickly align and fix the glued parts. Ensure each part fits tightly without any gaps.
4. **Wait for Glue to Cure:** Follow the curing time specified in the glue's instructions to ensure the parts are securely bonded.

## Important Notes

- Be careful not to apply too much glue to avoid overflow, which could affect the part's appearance or cause an improper bond.
- Choose a quick-curing glue to reduce waiting time and improve assembly efficiency.
- Ensure all parts have fully cooled before any assembly to allow the glue to cure properly.
- Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid exposure to glue fumes.
- Wear protective gloves when handling glue to avoid direct contact and prevent potential allergic reactions or skin irritation.
- During glue application and assembly, it is recommended to use a protective mat or waste paper to protect the surface, preventing glue spills from affecting unwanted areas or other parts.
